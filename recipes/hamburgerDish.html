      <li>1 (8 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 cup diced celery</li>
      <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
      <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
      <li>1 (4.5 ounce) can mushrooms</li>
      <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
      <li>1/2 cup salted cashews</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a casserole
        dish with butter. Arrange uncooked noodles in the prepared dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, onion,
        and celery in the hot skillet until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7
        minutes; drain and discard grease.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir condensed soups, mushrooms, and milk into beef mixture until evenly
        combined; pour over noodles in the dish. Cover the dish with aluminum
        foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and
        sprinkle cashews on top; continue baking until bubbling, about 30
        minutes more.
      </li>
    </ol>
